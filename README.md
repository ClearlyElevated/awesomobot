## What is AWESOM-O

AWESOM-O is an actively developed Discord bot with involvement from our community. Unlike most other bots, we try to push the limits of what can be done with the Discord API and frequently test new and creative ideas. Our flagship feature is a fully community driven script marketplace where users can easily add extensive functionality to the bot and customise it to their own liking.

Here is our full list of features:
- Online dashboard.
- Scripting engine.
- Community command marketplace.
- User profiles and stats.
- South Park related commands.
- Phone Destroyer card viewer.
- Server analytics. *(coming soon)*
- Server polls. *(coming soon)*

If you're interested in trying out AWESOM-O, you can visit [our Discord server](https://awesomo.feinwaru.com) or add the bot to your own! Please note that currently, all bot features are exclusive to our [Patreon supporters](https://www.patreon.com/awesomo), although that will probably change in the future.

## Bugs and feature requests

If you think you've found a bug with our bot, either through using it in Discord or running the code yourself, please feel free to open an issue.

When opening issues, make sure of the following:
- You've read the issues section of our [contribution guilde](#contributing).
- There are no other issues with the same problem already open.
- You adhere, as much as you can, to our issue templates.

You can also open issues for feature requests. These issues follow the same rules as explained above.

## Community

If you have any questions or just want to talk to us, we have a [Discord server](https://discord.feinwaru.com) that you can join. We will also post any updates for our bot on the above mentioned server.

if you're not into Discord, in which case I don't know why you're looking at Discord bots, we also have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/feinwaru) which we use occasionally for community announcements and large updates.

As mentioned above, this is a community driven project, and we would really appreciate any feedback that you could give us!

## Documentation

You can find AWESOM-O's documentation on [our website](https://awesomo.feinwaru.com/docs/welcome). The documentation mostly focuses on how to use the bot and our rest API.

Legacy documentation for major releases will be made available here.

## Contributing

Please read through our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/feinwarusoftware/awesomobot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Included are directions for opening issues, coding standards, and notes on development.

Moreover, if your pull request contains JavaScript patches or features, you will need to include the relevant unit tests in the future. All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](https://github.com/mdo/code-guide), maintained by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo).

## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, AWESOM-O is maintained under the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/feinwarusoftware/awesomobot/releases) for changelogs for each release version of AWESOM-O. Release announcement posts on [our Discord server](https://discord.feinwaru.com) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.

If possible, we plan to release a new version of the bot every 4 weeks, with hotfixes released as required.
