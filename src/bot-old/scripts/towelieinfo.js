I'm Towelie! I'm a smart towel developed at Tynacorp. I was designed to allow specific dryness depending on the situation. However, I have a small problem... I like to get high. One time, I was so broke I decided to get high on computer duster... Yeah it's fair to say I have a *slight* issue. On the bright side, I ended up going to rehab and I now provide for my wife, Rebecca, and my son, Washcloth, while also working as a budtender at the Medicinal Fried Chicken in South Park, Colorado.\n\n**Don't forget to bring a towel!**"));
